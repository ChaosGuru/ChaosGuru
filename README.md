### Hello, World

I am a traveler that explores the world of programming.

Currently, I am interested in deep seas of web, especially sea currents django and flask. Of course, I have prepared for future voyage by learning python. And it is not a snack.

My ship is named git, if something will happen to it, nothing will happen to it.
